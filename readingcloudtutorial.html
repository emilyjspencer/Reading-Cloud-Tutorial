      <p>The Reading Cloud is the school's library management system and digital catalogue. It allows you to search for books in the library from the comfort of your own home, and even reserve books from home, or from anywhere where you have an internet connection.</p>

          <li>Password: Your password is your date of birth as eigh digits. For example, if you were born on <strong>August 1 2007</strong>, your password will be: <strong>01082007.<br>

    <header><strong>Searching for a Book</strong></header>
    <article>
      <p>It is very easy to check whether the library has the book that you are looking for: simply type the name of the book, and the book will appear in the search results if we have it</p>

    <header><strong>What do the colours mean</strong></header>
    <article>
      <p>If the book that you are looking for is indeed in stock, you will notice that there are three coloured dots next to the picture of the book. The different colours represent different things:
        <ul>
          <li>The green circle tells you whether the book is available or not, and if there are multiple copies in the library. It shows how many of those copires are available to borrow.</li>
          <li>The red circle stands for reservations. It shows whether the book has been reserved and if so, how many other students have reserved the book.</li>
          <li>The blue circle shows how many copies of a book we have in total in the library.</li>
      </ul>

    <article>
      <p>If you find that the library stocks a book that you are looking forward but it is currently on loan, you can reserve the book so that when it is returned, the librarian will put the book aside for you and contact you to inform you that the book is now available. Simply click on the green 'Reserve' button at the top of the page to reserve the book.</p>

    <header><strong>Writing a Review</strong></header>
    <article>
      <p>It is a good idea to write a book review of every book that you read, even if it is only a few lines long. A good way to write and record your review is by using the Reading Cloud's built-in 'Write a Review' functionality. You can write a review by clicking on the blue 'Create Review' button, which is right next to the 'Reserve' button.</p>

    <header><strong>Recording a Video Review</strong></header>
    <article>
      <p>If the thought of writing a book review doesn't appeal to you, you could record a video review instead. Again, all you need to do is click on the 'Create Review' button, and instead of typing into the text box, click on the 'Video Review' button at the bottom of the page.</p>

        Fiction(story books) are all located downstairs and are arranged by the surname of the author. For example, if you are looking for a book from the popular Harry Potter series, there will be a sticker on the book's spine with the first three letters of author J K Rowling's surname: ROW.
        Non-fiction books(fact-based books) are all located upstairs, apart from the biographies and autobiographies. These books are arranged according to something called the <strong>Dewey Decimal System</strong>
